If you've ever written a ZK circuit, you know the pain. You write constraints in one DSL, generate witnesses in JavaScript, download a Powers of Tau file, run a trusted setup, invoke snarkjs three separate times, and pray everything lines up. Seven steps, three tools, two languages — just to prove you know a number.

I built Achronyme to make this simpler.

## What is Achronyme?

Achronyme is a programming language where the same syntax can run as a general-purpose program or compile to arithmetic constraints for zero-knowledge proofs.

Here's what proving a Poseidon commitment looks like:

```ach
let secret = 0p12345
let blinding = 0p98765

let p = prove {
    witness secret
    witness blinding
    public commitment
    assert_eq(poseidon(secret, blinding), commitment)
}

print(proof_json(p))    // Groth16 proof, verifiable on-chain
assert(verify_proof(p)) // verified
```

Six lines. One file. The `prove {}` block compiles a circuit, captures variables from scope, generates a witness, and returns a cryptographic proof — all inline. No ceremony.

Compare that to the Circom equivalent: write a template, compile to WASM, generate witness with JavaScript, download ptau, run trusted setup, prove, verify. Seven steps across three different tools.

## Dual Execution

The core idea is dual execution from the same source:

**VM mode** (`ach run`) gives you a real programming language — closures, recursion, mark-sweep GC, arrays, maps, strings, 43 native functions. Write algorithms, manipulate data, prepare inputs.

**Circuit mode** (`ach circuit`) compiles the same syntax to R1CS or Plonkish constraints over BN254. Loops unroll statically, `if/else` becomes `mux`, functions inline at every call site. The output is a flat constraint system ready for proof generation.

The `prove {}` block bridges both: it runs inside the VM but compiles its body as a circuit.

## Native Provers

Achronyme includes native Groth16 (ark-groth16) and PlonK (halo2-KZG) backends compiled directly into the binary. No Node.js, no snarkjs, no external dependencies. Proofs are generated in-process.

```bash
# Groth16 (default)
ach run my_proof.ach

# PlonK
ach run my_proof.ach --prove-backend plonkish

# Compile circuit + generate Solidity verifier
ach circuit vote.ach --inputs "..." --solidity Verifier.sol
```

The `.r1cs` and `.wtns` output files are also snarkjs-compatible, so you can use external tooling if you prefer.

## What's Included

This isn't a prototype. The current release (v0.1.0-beta.7) ships with:

- **1,300+ unit tests and 150+ integration tests** — every feature is tested across both execution modes
- **SSA IR with 4 optimization passes** — constant folding, dead code elimination, boolean propagation, taint analysis
- **Rustc-style diagnostics** — errors with source snippets, "did you mean?" suggestions, warning codes
- **Module system** — `import`/`export`, circular dependency detection, module caching
- **VS Code extension** — syntax highlighting and real-time error detection via LSP
- **Install script** — one command to get started

## Get Started

```bash
curl -fsSL https://achrony.me/install.sh | sh
```

This installs the `ach` binary to `~/.local/bin`. Then:

```bash
ach --version          # verify
ach run script.ach     # run a program
ach circuit circ.ach   # compile a circuit
ach disassemble f.ach  # inspect bytecode or IR
```

## What's Next

The roadmap toward 1.0:

- **0.1.0** — first stable release (stdlib, polished imports)
- **0.2.0** — LSP completions, go-to-definition, hover docs
- **0.3.0** — browser playground (WASM compiler + VM)
- **1.0.0** — stable API freeze, multi-curve support

If you write ZK circuits and you're tired of the ceremony, give Achronyme a try. I'd love to hear what you think.
